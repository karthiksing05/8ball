"NHTSA is drafting rules on autonomous vehicles, but it has been slow to regulate semi-autonomous vehicles," said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina. "Because NHTSA has put in place no requirements, manufacturers can operate and test vehicles virtually anywhere, even if the location exceeds the AV control systems limitations," the letter said. Arizona's transport department requires companies to submit regular filings to verify, among other things, that vehicles can operate safely if the autonomous technology fails. Such rules allow companies such as Alphabet's Google and General Motors, among others, to test their Waymo and Cruise vehicles on public roads. The NTSB, a U.S. government agency charged with investigating road accidents, has criticized NHTSA's hands-off approach to regulating cars with self-driving features and AVs. RED FLAGS Concerns about the safety of autonomous driving technology, however, have been mounting in recent years and Tesla has warned about its limitations. U.S. safety regulators, police and local government have investigated all four incidents, officials told Reuters.
20 -- Tesla Motors Inc. has issued an apology to a Chinese customer after two government entities criticized the quality of its cars and treatment of customers. Bloomberg's Katrina Nicholas reports on 'Bloomberg Markets: China Open'. Apr.
Total first-quarter vehicle registrations in the 22 states where data was collected stood at 44,502, with Model Y accounting for more than half of the registrations. Tesla, whose shares surged more than 700% in 2020, is expected to report first-quarter results after market close on April 26. The automaker reported record vehicle deliveries for the January-to-March quarter earlier this month, as solid demand for less expensive models offset the impact of a global shortage of parts. Tesla had earlier said it was receiving strong reception of the Model Y in China and is quickly progressing to full production capacity in the country.
Carmarkers' preference for cleaner sources of aluminum and cobalt suggest they'll follow a similar line on nickel, said Socrates Economou, head of nickel and cobalt trading at Trafigura. 'The technology is definitely real, but does not meet ESG standards,' said Jon Lamb, portfolio manager at metals and mining investment firm Orion Resource Partners. 'The game itself is actually how do we put nickel units into a growing nickel market,' he said. 'You need higher prices of $19,000 per ton imminently to incentivize the correct nickel output that the market needs,' Economou said in an interview. 'There will be more Tsingshans, there'll be more people with breakthrough technology that will be able to create battery-grade nickel feed'. Still, Vale didn't sever its ties altogether, retaining a right to some of the metal. According to mining magnate Robert Friedland, there are a lot of 'fantasies' about where battery-grade nickel is going to come from.

We are excited about the prospect of the P5," said Gu, referring the early trend in reservations for the P5. Our intention is to design a car that actually can drive on the road, but it can take off vertically and flying in low altitude scenarios below 100 meters. Xpeng said earlier this month that it delivered a total of 5,102 EVs in March, up 384% from a year ago and up 130% from February. Added Gu, "I think the initial applications of this flying car will be for hobbyists in certain limited settings. The P5 will play a key role in keeping Xpeng's sales hot this year, which is what Wall Street has come to expect from the China-based EV maker. This week at the Shanghai Auto Show, Xpeng showed off its electric Heitech flying vehicle.
Last month, Tesla came under scrutiny in China when the military banned its cars from entering its complexes, citing security concerns over cameras in its vehicles, sources told Reuters. Zhang was ordered detained for "disrupting public order," while Li received a warning, police said. "Individuals should not take extreme measures, and enterprises should not be arrogant and unreasonable," the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said late on Tuesday. Earlier this month, Tesla said cameras in its cars are not activated outside of North America. The incident continued to attract social media attention on Tuesday, accounting for two of the top 10 trending topics on the Twitter-like Weibo platform. That prompted founder Elon Musk to say that if Tesla used cameras to spy in China or anywhere, it would be shut down. Tesla sells roughly 30% of its cars in China, made at its Shanghai factory.

That's based on 11 analysts recommending a Buy, 8 analysts suggesting a Hold, and 7 analysts proposing a Sell. The report quoted Musk's tweet, 'Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled & this car did not purchase FSD [Full Self-Driving]'. According to the report, the Tesla car crash on Saturday night would be the 28th Tesla accident that would be investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). (See Tesla stock analysis on TipRanks) On April 13, Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy reiterated a Hold and a price target of $800 on the stock. Musk also added that 'standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have'. Reuters also said that the car crash is also being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Meanwhile, TSLA scores a Hold consensus rating from the analyst community.
BRIAN SOZZI: And Brian, also, XPeng created quite the buzz at the Auto Show, showed off a flying car-- or maybe it's not even a car-- a flying vehicle. But the P5, the newly launched one, will have a lot more space in both the passenger side, as well as the cabin side. Well, first of all, I think P5 will incorporate the world's first Lidar incorporated autonomous driving sensor package in a production vehicle. This is actually, I will say, the world's first sort of a driver sort of a license that automakers are doing for the technology. BRIAN GU: This is actually critical, as you said, to really educate the driver to properly use autonomous features. In China, right now, our autonomous driving package allows car to drive on highways using autonomous driving. And also, just another thing just to know is that in China, we are still actually I would say not completely autonomous driving yet.

And yet, when you look at the supply chain, so much of that is-- ties directly to China, whether that's solar energy or battery technology, other technology, green technology. Together, that's going to be a magnificent signal that right here in the United States, we're going to start manufacturing the supply chain and grabbing that back. GINA MCCARTHY: Well, first of all, thanks for having me here, and happy Earth week. This is not about stopping permitting, just leases, recognizing that there's a lot of leases out there that are not being worked where there's no activity. And we have to start looking at how we move forward not just as countries, separate countries, but as the world to address the challenge of climate change. We're looking at areas of our country that have been disinvested in because, for example, in coal country where coal has become less competitive. We know, even in the prior administration, that-- that their interest in rebuilding coal has fallen short because clean energy is cheaper.

"And there's a lot of scrutiny surrounding Tesla because of their autopilot technology, because of some of the claims that Elon Musk and the company make surrounding the technology". In fact, in the next six months or so, you will see Lucid and Rivian vehicles on the road. The latest concerns around the safety of Tesla's vehicles also presents a near-term risk to the stock, according to Nelson. General Motors upped its planned investments into electric and electric-autonomous vehicles to $27 billion in November, up from the $20 billion planned before the COVID-19 pandemic. And in addition to smaller U.S.-based upstarts like Lucid and Rivian, a number of major automakers have also been pushing more fervently into the electric-vehicle space.

'There is no metric, there is no yes or no, black or white,' she said. 'With a new administration in place, we're reviewing regulations around autonomous vehicles,' the agency said last month. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, whose department included NHTSA, said the proposal would address safety 'without hampering innovation in development of automated driving systems'. 'Elon's been totally irresponsible,' said Alain Kornhauser, faculty chair of autonomous vehicle engineering at Princeton University. Tesla TSLA, +0.61% , which has disbanded its media relations office, did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Musk, he said, has sold the dream that the cars can drive themselves even though in the fine print Tesla says they're not ready. Missy Cummings, an electrical and computer engineering professor at Duke University who studies automated vehicles, said the Texas crash is a watershed moment for NHTSA.

In public presentations and slideshows, DMV Deputy Director Bernard Soriano described Level 4 automation, which requires no human driver, this way: 'Full self-driving'. 'You've got the market getting ahead of regulators, which isn't uncommon, but this all didn't start yesterday'. Incidents such as the fatal Texas crash 'are foreseeable incidents,' Levine said, 'no matter how many disclaimers Tesla lawyers decide to insert in fine print'. 'It is predictable when you call something Autopilot it means autopilot, and when you call something Full Self-Driving it means full self-driving,' he said. 'I suspect there will be big fallout from this,' said Alain Kornhauser, head of the driverless car program at Princeton University. Since 2016, NHTSA has launched investigations into at least 23 crashes involving Autopilot; but if they resulted in any conclusion or action, NHTSA hasn't told the public about it. The agency, an arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation, said it 'will take appropriate steps when we have more information'.

RICK NEWMAN: Well, a car went flying off a road near Houston, hit a tree, exploded, and burned for hours. In the latest sensational Tesla crash, a Model S sedan flew off a road near Houston on April 17, hit a tree, exploded and burned for hours. In fact, technically, Tesla says the driver needs to be able to retake control of the car on a split second's notice. Tesla is the only company that has a mounting death toll, if you will, connected with its self-driving system. And Tesla, if this were another automaker, you have to wonder, would there be more scrutiny of this? But they do gather data on all those cars, which is a genuine advance that Tesla has brought to the market, the real-time connectivity with the cars. SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Rick, I want to follow up on that.

On February 1, Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the NTSB, wrote to the Department of Transportation criticizing lax safety standards for self-driving systems, citing Tesla as a particular concern. In the latest sensational Tesla crash, a Model S sedan flew off a road near Houston on April 17, hit a tree, exploded and burned for hours. The General Motors Supercruise system, for instance, uses a camera to assure the driver's eyes stay focused on the road when the system is on. The 2019 Florida fatality, Sumwalt said, might not have happened if the department had required Tesla to improve Autopilot's safety protocols following the 2016 Florida fatality. This year, Tesla is rolling out what it calls a 'full-self driving subscription,' available as a $10,000 software upgrade on most models. What Musk can't demonstrate, however, is how much safer Autopilot would be if the safety protocols were stricter and the company promoted it less aggressively. Unlike Autopilot, which operates on any road, Supercruise only works on roads GM has determined fit the safety parameters of the system.
And you know, some of the Tesla's claims regarding the technology, you know, a lot of people view as irresponsible. But you know, these sorts of headlines don't help, and they don't instill confidence in that technology, which many people are very skeptical of. - Garrett, just looking out more broadly at this space, a lot of different companies trying to jump into let's move now to autonomous vehicles. And there's a lot of reluctance out there, you know, and calls for-- from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill to really clamp down. We know that anytime a Tesla vehicle is involved in a high-profile crash such as this one, with very suspicious circumstances, it garners a lot of attention. So when they call this feature full self-driving, you know, are consumers actually thinking they're getting a full autonomous vehicle. So you know, they just haven't had the competition, and they've really benefited from that.

International Business Machines Corp, another blue-chip company, slipped about 0.22% ahead of its results after market close. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 firms to have grown 30.9% from a year ago, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Coca-Cola Co rose 0.35% after the beverage maker trounced estimates for quarterly profit and revenue, benefiting from the easing of pandemic curbs and wide vaccine rollouts. The S&P 500 has gained the past four weeks, its longest winning streak since August 2020. The S&P 500 posted 59 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 81 new lows.
But when you think about how Tesla is rolling this out, too, right, I mean, this is an option that, to your point, they're advertising as auto-pilot. In the United States, I think there have been so far, as far as we know, 11 crashes involving nine fatalities. AKIKO FUJITA: And on that front, Rick, we're seeing shares of Tesla coming off of the session lows, but still down more than 3%. So, and they have acknowledged this in regulatory filings, where you can't use the marketing brochure, or Elon Musk has to tone down his rhetoric a little bit. Because, Rick, I mean, we've talked about this feature in the past. And they also don't describe their systems as fully self-driving systems, as you might think it is, if it's called auto-pilot. RICK NEWMAN: I mean, just to put this in context, Tesla's autopilot system is no better than other systems.
"If he is tweeting that out, if he has already pulled the data, he hasn't told us that," Herman told Reuters. The NTSB, which makes safety recommendations but cannot compel recalls, said its investigation into the Texas crash would focus "on the vehicle's operation and the post-crash fire". 'SHOULDN'T BE A DEATH RISK' Tesla's Autopilot system, which was operating in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016, has come under increasing scrutiny. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that "using Tesla's driverless system ' or any other ' shouldn't be a death risk. Just hours before the crash, Musk had tweeted: "Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle". Tesla has access to operational and diagnostic data delivered to its servers at "regular intervals" from the car, which has been impounded by police. The crash is the 28th Telsa accident to be investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which regulates vehicle safety.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tesla would post earnings of $0.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.80, delivering a surprise of -11.11%. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 26, 2021, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. For Tesla, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. Zacks Consensus Estimate This electric car maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.79 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +216%.

There was no one in the driver's seat, according to Mark Herman, Harris County, Texas, Precinct 4 Constable. Tesla's driver-assist Autopilot, which reportedly may have been involved in the crash, is meant to be used with someone ready to take over the vehicle. The Nasdaq Composite, for instance, is down almost 1% at the time of this writing. One person was believed to be in the front passenger's seat and the other was sitting in the back of the vehicle, Herman told The Wall Street Journal. The electric car maker reports earnings for its first quarter of 2021 after market close on Monday, April 26. Now what Next week, investors will get insight into Tesla's recent business performance. Though the automaker intends to eventually release a full self-driving ability for its cars, it hasn't done so yet.
Each time an accident happens, though, worries rise that regulators might take steps slowing the pace of autonomous vehicle innovation both for Tesla and for other automakers. When first responders arrived to put out a fire that resulted, they found that no one was in the vehicle's driver's seat. On Monday, shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pulled back on news regarding a car crash and its Autopilot system. Upon completion of the report, regulators will decide whether to allow the deal to move forward or conduct an even longer inquiry. Back in 2016, a Florida driver died after the Model S he was driving crashed into a turning truck while the Autopilot mode was engaged. At worst, what U.K. regulators find will either force major changes to the terms of the buyout or even kill it entirely. Wall Street has been in rally mode for a while now, but Monday brought a pause in the recent gains for major stock market benchmarks.

So, to your point, Myles, on company response, like, take the name autopilot off the thing. But, you know, words matter, and there's a lot in this name, as you mentioned, Julie. And I know that, to your point, Julie, people who follow this story very closely are well aware that Tesla's autopilot feature is not full autopilot. Now, the early reports, and this hasn't been confirmed yet, the early reports makes it sound as though these men were using the autopilot feature on the Tesla. Now, as we've known, as has been widely reported, autopilot ain't really autopilot. It is called autopilot, even though the company has said, and I think many users are aware, that it is not full self-driving car. Whether it's a new product, or I'm not so sure what it is, but clearly, something needs to be put in place here.
NTSB, which has investigated numerous previous Tesla crashes, isn't planning on opening a new probe into the latest incident, spokesman Chris O'Neil said. The position of the victims, statements and other physical evidence suggest that 'no one was driving the vehicle at the time of impact,' Herman said. Herman said his office is coordinating with federal authorities, without specifying which ones, and didn't know whether the Autopilot feature was engaged.

The tycoon's coterie of rich friends, among others, have stumped up billions, but making cars -- electric or otherwise -- is hard, and hugely capital intensive. While it's established three production bases -- in Guangzhou, Tianjin in China's north, and Shanghai -- the company doesn't have a general car assembly line up and running. 'There's a standard engineering process of product development, validation and verification, which includes several laboratory and road tests' in China and everywhere else, Zhong said. 'Weird Company' 'It's a weird company,' said Bill Russo, the founder and chief executive officer of advisory firm Automobility Ltd. in Shanghai. Two models, including the Hengchi 5, a compact SUV that rivals Xpeng's G3, are targeting mass production in a little over 20 months. 'The market is getting crowded but unless you have a preferred lane, there's not much chance to win,' Automobility's Russo said. Still, Evergrande NEV's stock has gained 18% since then, buoyed by the outlook for China's electric-car market.

The former employee's legal representative, in a statement sent to Reuters, claimed that Cao did not provide any Tesla data to Xpeng or any other entity. In addition, said the representative, Cao didn't personally access any of Tesla's information. The company has intimated that, in time, Autopilot will include self-driving functionalities. The company settled a lawsuit it brought in 2019 against Cao Guangzhi, accusing him of copying the source code of its Autopilot assisted driving software platform. Tesla had alleged Cao had done so before joining XMotors, the U.S. business of China-based autonomous-driving company Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV). Although the name implies an autonomous driving system, Autopilot is actually a set of assisted-driving solutions including next-generation cruise control and parking assist. Autopilot is an attractive feature that helps draw customers, and as such it's worth protecting.

In October, auto industry legend, GM announced that it's majority-owned subsidiary, Cruise, has just received approval from the California DMV to test its autonomous vehicles without a driver. John Davis, chief engineer of Ford's autonomous vehicle subsidiary explained, 'We're confident that we're on the path to launching a safe, reliable and affordable service. With the news of GM's new business unit, BrightDrop, they plan to sell electric vans and services to commercial delivery companies, disrupting the market for delivery logistics. Ford plans to test these vehicles in Austin, Texas; Detroit; Miami; Palo Alto, California; Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. as early as this month.

Changan, which has a venture with Ford, lost 4,000 yuan ($611.86) per car because it needed to buy credits or sell unprofitable EVs, he told an industry conference. All six major state-owned auto groups are struggling to comply with the credit system, the chairman of state-owned automaker Changan, Zhu Huarong, said in January. Tesla, the leading electric vehicle maker, is the top green credit generator in China, according to MIIT. Automakers under compliance pressure include Geely, General Motor Co's China tie-up with SAIC Motor, Daimler AG's partnership with BAIC Motor, another Volkswagen venture with SAIC Motor. FAW-Volkswagen, which sold 2.16 million cars last year, was the biggest negative credit generator in 2019 thanks to its popular gasoline sport-utility vehicles. Electric vehicle sales were lower in 2020 than policymakers had expected, explaining the credit deficit, Haitong International analyst Shi Ji said. Geely, Daimler, GM all told Reuters they will manage the credits between different ventures and will comply with the rules by expanding electric lineup in next years.
Both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which regulates vehicle safety, and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) both said they would investigate. Last week, Tesla boss Elon Musk said his vehicles almost had a "ten times lower" chance of an accident when they had their autopilot engaged than normal cars. Local police in Texas said the car, a 2019 Model S, had been travelling at high speed and had failed to navigate a turn. The company has also batted off concerns over its autopilot functions, which allow the vehicles to take some control over acceleration, steering and braking. 'Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have'. The National Transportation Safety Board last year said it was "time to stop enabling drivers in any partially automated vehicle to pretend that they have driverless cars'. Harris County precinct constable Mark Herman said authorities were "very confident just with the positioning of the bodies after the impact that there was no one driving that vehicle".
Over the past two years, the number of miles driven per accident, with the Autopilot on, has increased 18%. Harris County deputies said the vehicle was traveling at high speed, failed to take a turn at a cul-de-sac, ran off the road and hit the tree. No one was driving the vehicle, and two people were killed, Houston TV station KPRC reported. According to KHOU in Houston, firefighters had to use 30,000 gallons of water over four hours to put out the fire, as the Tesla's battery kept reigniting. What Happened: On Saturday, a Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S crashed into a tree in Woodlands, Texas. In a tweet, a KHOU reporter also quoted investigators saying there was no one in the driving seat driving the car at the time of the incident. In comparison, the NHTSA reports one accident for about 475,000 miles driven for all U.S. vehicles.
The accident comes amid growing scrutiny over Tesla's semi-automated driving system following recent accidents and as it is preparing to launch its updated "full self-driving" software to more customers. 'There was no one in the driver's seat," Sgt. The U.S. auto safety agency said in March it has opened 27 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles; at least three of the crashes occurred recently. The self-driving technology must overcome safety and regulatory hurdles to achieve commercial success. Umanzor said the two crash victims were born in 1962 and 1951. Cinthya Umanzor of the Harris County Constable Precinct 4 said. Tesla and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"Our preliminary investigation is determining - but it's not complete yet - that there was no one at the wheel of that vehicle," the constable was quoted as saying. The vehicle was traveling at high speed along a curve before it hit a tree around 11:25 p.m. local time, the official told the newspaper. Authorities were still investigating as of Sunday morning whether the front passenger air bag was deployed, the report added.

In February, he simply tweeted, "Doge," followed shortly by, "Dogecoin is the people's crypto". Another well-known tweet featured a mock-up of Vogue magazine with, you guessed it, the word "Dogue" in place of the magazine's title. After each one, the coin's value soars -- so much so that it's been dubbed the "Musk effect". Its low price, low transaction costs, and active community captured the imaginations of many people who'd never invested in crypto before. For some, the big draw is the idea that if you'd bought $1 worth of Bitcoin back in 2010, it would be worth about $7 million today. And it's worth noting that in spite of Musk's enthusiasm, it's Bitcoin -- not Dogecoin -- that you can use to buy a Tesla car.
Most recently, dogecoin (DOGE-USD) stole the spotlight from bitcoin and ethereum this week after it surged more than 200% in 24 hours, giving it a market cap of $52bn. On Sunday, the flagship crypto shed nearly $8,000 and was trading 12% lower at $54,900 around 12PM in London, down from a day high of $61,293. In October last year, Bitcoin got a big boost in sentiment after California-based payments platform, PayPal (PYPL) allowed its customers to hold the cryptocurrency in their digital wallets. Earlier in 2021, the market value of all bitcoin in circulation hit $1trn for the first time, after a more than 800% surge. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is experiencing a massive sell-off, shedding almost 15% in the last 24 hours ' the biggest intraday drop since February. This helped cryptocurrencies gain more popularity in recent months, especially bitcoin, which has more than doubled in value in the last six months. It added that, among other risks, cryptocurrencies "may cause non-recoverable losses for the parties to the transactions" due to the lack of regulation.

The company is already exploring medical science, self-driving cars and their concomitant ride-hailing services, a drone delivery network, mapping the ocean floor, and data-based agriculture. This company has dominated many markets before with products like Android, Chrome, Google Search, and YouTube. This Friday, the company acquired the advanced video advertising division of my former employer, media measurement expert Nielsen Media (NYSE:NLSN). This particular innovator may have somewhat less lofty goals than Tesla and Alphabet, but maybe that's just because it's a much smaller company right now. It's all about solar power, deep-space travel, and artificial intelligence in the end. As a leading provider of battle-tested hardware and software platforms for streaming media services, Roku doesn't really care who becomes the leading provider of digital media. Come back in 10 or 20 years, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the old Google business transformed into just a minor contributor to Alphabet's multi-industry operations.

On the other hand, Robinhood investors have a history of chasing penny stocks, momentum plays, or businesses that aren't fundamentally sound.

In one respect, it's a fantastic thing to see young people putting their money to work in one of the world's top wealth creators.

Brian Feroldi: Four of my biggest holdings are Tesla, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix. For me, when I run these companies through the anti-fragile framework, CrowdStrike is very high, so is Amazon. I think they're going to continue to produce just fine returns over time, but CrowdStrike, I think it's going to be a lot bigger in 10 years.

FTSE 100 (^FTSE) Ocado, which will take a seat on Oxbotica's board, said introducing the autonomous tech could potentially save money.
